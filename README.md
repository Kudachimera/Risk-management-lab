<h1> IT Risk Management & Threat Modeling lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we are going to walk through how to conduct an information technology risk management process using risk scenarios for the organisation. We will conduct the risk assessment to our organisation a SME (Small Medium Enterprise company). We will also learn how to conduct cyber security threat modeling using a simple method. We will quantitatively analyze and calculate the organisation IT risk to identify highest risk areas that the organisation can prioritize.
<br />

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft excel </b> 
- <b>ISACA Risk scenarios </b>
- <b> COBIT 19 Framework </b>

<h2> Threat Modeling </h2>

- <b> Threat modeling is a systematic approach to identifying and analyzing potential threats to a system or organization's security, and determining the potential impact of these threats. 
-Threat modeling involves identifying potential vulnerabilities in a system or network, and evaluating the likelihood and impact of various threats exploiting those  vulnerabilities.
- In simple terms threat modeling is identifying what kind of threats affect an environment or organisation.
 
 <h2>Objective of threat modeling </h2>
The objective of threat modeling is to enable you to better understand the security risks associated with a system or organisation, so that you can prioritize security measures and allocate resources more effectively.By identifying and prioritizing potential threats,you can develop more effective security controls and respond more quickly to security incidents.
<br />

<h2>Factors to consider on threat modeling </h2>
The following are 2 major factors to consider when conducting threat modeling :

1. Industry : Threats that affect manufacturing are different from threats that affect healthcare industry. You need to understand which industry are you operating in.

2. Size of enterprise : How big is the organisation,there are different threats that affect only big organisation rather small organisation.

<br />

 <h2> Simple method to conduct threat modeling :</h2>
There are various methodologies for conducting threat modeling, but the following simple steps can be adopted:

You need to stay informed every single day,stay up to date with current news. Listen to reliable cybersecurity podcast e.g Cisoseries.com. 

1. Identify the system components and assets that need to be protected in the organisation

2. Identify potential threats (from your immediate current news research) that high risk to the organisation

3. Assess the likelihood and potential impact of each threat in relation to your organisation

4. Develop security controls to mitigate the highest-priority threats.

5. Test and refine the security controls to ensure they are effective and efficient

<h2> Conclusion :</h2>
Threat modeling is an important tool in the cybersecurity toolkit, helping organizations to stay ahead of evolving threats and protect against potential security breaches

<h2>RISK MANAGEMENT </h2>

Risk Management<br/>

Risk management process involves identify processes or systems that may have areas that are not operating effectively and/or efficiently that could put the enterprise at risk.

One technique for conducting risk assessment is to use risk scenarios.

Risk scenarios facilitate communication in risk management by constructing a narrative that can inspire people to act. The use of risk scenarios can enhance the risk management effort by helping the risk team understand and explain risk to business process owners and other stakeholders. Additionally, a well-developed scenario provides a realistic and practical view of risk that is more aligned with business objectives, historical events and emerging threats forecasted by the organization than would be found by consulting a broadly applicable standard or catalog of controls. These benefits make risk scenarios valuable as a means of gathering and framing information used in subsequent steps in the risk management process.

The core approach of using risk scenarios is to brings realism, insight, organizational engagement, improved analysis and structure to the complex matter of I&T risk. Once scenarios are developed, they are used during the risk analysis phase, in which frequency and business impacts are estimated.
