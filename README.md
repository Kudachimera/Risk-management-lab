<h1> Cyber Security Risk Management using NIST SP 800-30 </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we are going to walk through how to conduct a cybersecurity risk management process in accordance to NIST SP 800-30. We will customise the framework to make it applicable to our organisation and industry a SME (Small Medium Enterprise company). We will also learn how to conduct threat modeling using a simple method. We will semi-quantitatively analyze cybersecurity risk using NIST SP 800-30 methodology to identify highest risk weaknesses for a system.
<br />

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft excel </b> 
- <b>NIST SP 800-30</b>

<h2> Threat Modeling </h2>

- <b> Threat modeling is a systematic approach to identifying and analyzing potential threats to a system or organization's security, and determining the potential impact of these threats. 
-Threat modeling involves identifying potential vulnerabilities in a system or network, and evaluating the likelihood and impact of various threats exploiting those  vulnerabilities.
- In simple terms threat modeling is identifying what kind of threats affect an environment or organisation.
 
 <h2>Objective of threat modeling </h2>
The objective of threat modeling is to enable you to better understand the security risks associated with a system or organisation, so that you can prioritize security measures and allocate resources more effectively.By identifying and prioritizing potential threats,you can develop more effective security controls and respond more quickly to security incidents.
<br />

<h2>Factors to consider on threat modeling </h2>
The following are 2 major factors to consider when conducting threat modeling :

1. Industry : Threats that affect manufacturing are different from threats that affect healthcare industry. You need to understand which industry are you operating in.

2. Size of enterprise : How big is the organisation,there are different threats that affect only big organisation rather small organisation.

<br />

 <h2> Simple method to conduct threat modeling :</h2>
There are various methodologies for conducting threat modeling, but the following simple steps can be adopted:

You need to stay informed every single day,stay up to date with current news. Listen to reliable cybersecurity podcast e.g Cisoseries.com. 

1. Identify the system components and assets that need to be protected in the organisation

2. Identify potential threats (from your immediate current news research) that high risk to the organisation

3. Assess the likelihood and potential impact of each threat in relation to your organisation

4. Develop security controls to mitigate the highest-priority threats.

5. Test and refine the security controls to ensure they are effective and efficient

<h2> Conclusion :</h2>
Threat modeling is an important tool in the cybersecurity toolkit, helping organizations to stay ahead of evolving threats and protect against potential security breaches
